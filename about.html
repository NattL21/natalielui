        <h1>Thanks for dropping by!</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone!! Iâ€™m Natalie and Iâ€™m currently and undergrad at UC Irvine studying computer science with a minor in informatics. My passion for exploring the crossroads of artistic expression and technology have led me to fall in love with UI design and UX development.</p>
        <h2>I am a âœ§ <span class="typing-about"></span> âœ§</h2>

  <div class="slide-left about-me-content">
    <h1><i>So why UI/UX?</i></h1>
    <p>A personal ideal that I consider my life motto is to <span class="hero-highlight">lead with empathy</span>. Itâ€™s a principle that I find reflected in every single aspect of my life. My love language towards others is creating thoughtful and meaningful gifts, I collect pieces of every place I visit to preserve cherished experiences; my world revolves around my <span class="hero-highlight">emotional connections with others</span>. I find so much joy in small details and intentionality and Iâ€™m driven by designing moments that make people feel seen and valued.</p>
    <p>Pursuing computer science was never really a question for me. Iâ€™ve always been drawn and challenged by the problem-solving, logic aspects of this field, but as I progressed I felt that I was missing something and as a result I was starting to lose that passion and drive.</p>
    <p>Something clicked for me when I started to explore UI/UX; it felt like the perfect intersection of my passions: the creativity of design, the analytical rigor of computer science, and, most importantly, the empathetic connection to people. I found myself immersed in a space where <span class="hero-highlight">technology becomes personal</span>. Being able to code and create experiences that felt intuitive and thoughtful towards user needs and values reignited my passion for computer science. It felt that I was finally able to find a space within the technological sphere that encompassed my values and aligned with who I was as a person.</p>
