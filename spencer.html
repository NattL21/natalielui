        <h1 class="slide-left">The Problem</h1>
        <p class="slide-right">Current sanitary product dispensers, specifically observed within educational institutions, are inadequate, often found understocked or broken. While many bathrooms are equipped with feminine hygiene product dispensers, more often than not they were not utilized to their full potential. We found that this left many people unable to access products when they needed them.</p>

            <h1>Our Product</h1>
            <p>Our team strived to answer the question of how we could increase <strong>ACCESSIBILITY</strong> to feminine hygiene products while maintaining <strong>EFFICIENCY</strong> and <strong>COST CONSCIENTIOUSNESS.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>S.P.E.N.C.E.R., is a dispensing machine that provides on-hand sanitary products, utilizing advanced sensor technology to determine product inventory as well as an app that provides easy access to track information in regards to each machine.</strong></p>

            <p class="slide-right">In order to properly assess how to improve access to sanitary products, we researched the current state of sanitary dispensation options and their shortcomings.</p>
            <p class="slide-right">We found that the current complaints largely revolved around current dispensers requiring coins â€“ which many people no longer carry around and machines, more often than not, remain un-stocked for long periods of time.</p>
            <p class="slide-right">âœ§ 86% of women reportedly started their period in public without the supplies they needed and 1 in 5 menstruating students are missing crucial learning opportunities due to a lack of period supplies.</p>

            <p class="spencer-features-text slide-right">A <strong>tap to pay option</strong> on top of the classic coin payment option in order to modernize payment collection - while the ultimate goal is to be able to provide free access to hygiene products, we understand that many organizations may not be able to afford this. Therefore, we hoped to make our machines as financially accessible as possible. These payments can be <strong>tracked and deposited to an external account</strong> through the app with ease and efficiency for our users. We also emphasized a visual comparison of each machine to allow our users to track where demand for their products may be higher.</p>

                <p>An <strong>internal tracker</strong> created using raspberry pi magnetic switches. One switch is a bar that rests on the top of the product chute, moving down as products are dispensed. Once the switches are close enough in vicinity, the mechanism sends a notification to the app that stock is low in that particular machine.</p>
                <p>An app prioritizing <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>clarity</strong> that allows users to track all the machines linked to the same account. The app includes details and updated stock levels of each machine, presented in both a list and map view - thus allowing users to visually see where all their machines are and track the statistics of each individual machine.</p>

However, we recognized the need for a more balanced visual identity that felt both clean and refined. To achieve this, we refined the color palette and visual elements to introduce a more formal tone while still preserving the floral inspiration that anchored the original theme.</p>

        <p class="slide-right">Our product successfully addresses the issues that women currently have with public dispensers which are: difficulties to pay for products and under-stocked, broken dispensers.</p>
        <p class="slide-right">Our user surveys found that 76% responded that they never use the sanitary product dispensers at school, but if they were given a Spencer dispenser, 81% said they would use them.</p>
        <p class="slide-right"><strong>âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ:* EXPANSION âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ:*</strong> <br> Our next steps and improvements involve implementing a working prototype in a public restroom to gather testing data.Â We hope to expand SPENCER to dispense more than just feminine hygiene products, such as school materials, testing supplies, etc.</p>
