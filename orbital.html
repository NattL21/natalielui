        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>Many Gen-Z college students struggle to stay motivated and organized when managing daily tasks, often leading to tasks piling up. This common issue results in stress and burnout, especially amongst students. </p>
        <p>Existing services are often too convoluted or uninspiring, lacking intuitive organization and features that encourage sustained engagement.</p>

        <h1>Our Solution</h1>
        <p>Our team set out to design a task management mobile application that helps students balance their responsibilities through streamlined organization and gamification engagement centered around the rising popularity in collecting blind boxes. 
           We wanted to create an interface that was clear but preserved the features we hoped to include such as a pomodoro timer and a collaborative aspect that allowed users to work with others. While these features helped make our app well rounded, 
           we still wanted the core purpose of the app - task management - to be streamlined and efficient for the user. </p>

        <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
        <p>We utilized multiple test subjects who walked through our app and provided feedback on the strengths and weak points from a user's perspective. We gathered that the app, specifically adding tasks, was easy to use and the blind box motivational aspect was an unique and engaging feature.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Some feedback we received:</span></p>
        <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm unsure how to use or access the blind box feature.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúI think there should be a way to mark off finished tasks or signal that they‚Äôre complete.‚Äù</p>

    <div class="slide-right">
        <p>Throughout the development process, we felt that we understood our problem statement very well and this reflected in our final product. We had unique and fresh ideas and our sketches and mid-fidelity wireframes translated seamlessly into our hi-fidelity prototype. We also had strong branding and mainly positive feedback from our usability testing.</p>
        <p>Our next steps to improve our product would be to refine the graphics and art style of the app. We struggled with finding an art style that encompassed our youthful tone, but didn‚Äôt restrict our possible audience and we would hopefully edit our graphics to find that balance. We would also work to refine certain UI interactions to refine the overall flow and readability to decrease clutter.</p>
